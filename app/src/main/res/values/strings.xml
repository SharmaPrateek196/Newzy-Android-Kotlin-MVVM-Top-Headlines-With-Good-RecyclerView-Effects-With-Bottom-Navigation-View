    <string name="sorry">Respected Sir and Madams, I am having a serious bug in implementation of
                    this Fragment. I know how to implement the search functionality, but due to shortage
                    of time I am not getting where I am wrong. If in future, I would see this fragment\'s code
                    I would definitely be able to solve this, but right now I am not getting the actual bug.
                    As the time is going beyond the deadline,
                    I am submitting the assignment.\n\n But I can assure you that I HAVE FULFILLED
                    THIS ASSIGNMENT\'S REST ALL REQUIREMENTS AND FEATURES.
                    \nThank you very much for giving me chance!
